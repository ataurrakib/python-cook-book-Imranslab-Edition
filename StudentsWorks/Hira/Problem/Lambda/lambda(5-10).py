6. Write a Python program to square and cube every number in a given list of integers using Lambda.
Original list of integers:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Square every number of the said list:
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
Cube every number of the said list:
[1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000]

'''
# wrong way
num = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print(num)
square_num = list(filter(lambda x: x ^ 2, num)) # don't use the filter method  && ^ don't
print(square_num)

'''
This is wright way 
'''

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print("Original list of integers:")
print(nums)
print("\nSquare every number of the said list:")
square_nums = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, nums))
print(square_nums)
print("\nCube every number of the said list:")
cube_nums = list(map(lambda x: x ** 3, nums))
print(cube_nums)
